            <p>
              SkyTracker provides a flight tracking service that allows users to search for and view information about

            <p>
              While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date flight information, we rely on third-party data

            <p>
              You acknowledge that you use the flight information at your own risk and should always verify critical
              flight details with the airline or airport directly.
            </p>
